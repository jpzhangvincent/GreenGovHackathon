# GreenGovHackathon
This is the repository for the Green Gov Challenge during 10/24 - 10/25/2015.

#Objecive:
As the state continues to deal with the effects of environmental change and the drought, California
government seeks to find innovative ways to reduce waste in resources and increase sustainable
practices.

As part of the Innovation the Department of General Services and Government Operation Agency
will host an open data code-a-thon in late October. This GreenGov Challenge will leverage publiclyavailable
data sources to help state government improve its sustainability operations and better
engage with the public.
